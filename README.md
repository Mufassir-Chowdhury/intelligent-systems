# **Personalized Knowledge Base Q\&A System Specification**

## **1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the specifications for a "Personalized Knowledge Base Q\&A System." The primary goal of this system is to enable users to query their personal collection of documents using natural language, leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate and contextually relevant responses, with an optional voice-enabled interface. This system aims to transform disparate personal information into a readily accessible and conversational knowledge source.

## **2\. System Overview**

The Personalized Knowledge Base Q\&A System will act as an intelligent assistant that allows users to upload, manage, and query their private documents. It will process these documents, create a searchable index, and, upon receiving a natural language query, retrieve relevant information from the user's documents. This retrieved information will then be used to augment a Large Language Model (LLM), which will synthesize a concise and accurate answer. An integrated voice agent will provide an intuitive conversational interface.

## **3\. Goals & Objectives**

* **Enable Natural Language Querying:** Allow users to ask questions about their documents in plain English (or other supported languages).  
* **Provide Accurate & Contextual Answers:** Utilize RAG to ensure responses are grounded in the user's specific documents, minimizing hallucinations.  
* **Support Diverse Document Formats:** Ingest and process various document types (PDFs, Word documents, Markdown, plain text, web articles).  
* **Offer Voice Interaction:** Provide a seamless speech-to-text input and text-to-speech output experience.  
* **Ensure Data Privacy & Security:** Maintain strict control over user data, ensuring it remains private and secure.  
* **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a growing volume of documents and user queries efficiently.  
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Provide an intuitive way to upload documents and interact with the Q\&A system.

## **4\. Key Features**

### **4.1. Document Ingestion & Management**

* **Multi-Format Support:** Ability to upload and process PDFs, .docx files, .txt files, .md files, and potentially web page URLs.  
* **Automated Parsing:** Extract clean text content from uploaded documents, handling various layouts (e.g., tables, images via OCR).  
* **Chunking:** Automatically segment documents into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks suitable for retrieval.  
* **Embedding Generation:** Convert document chunks into vector embeddings.  
* **Indexing:** Store document chunks and their embeddings in a vector database for efficient similarity search.  
* **Document Listing:** Display a list of uploaded documents with basic metadata (e.g., filename, upload date, size).  
* **Document Deletion:** Allow users to remove documents from their knowledge base.

### **4.2. Question & Answer Interface**

* **Natural Language Query Input:** A text input field for users to type their questions.  
* **Contextual Response Generation:** Generate answers based on the user's query and the most relevant retrieved document chunks.  
* **Source Citation:** Provide references (e.g., document name, page number/chunk ID) for the information used in the answer, enhancing trustworthiness.  
* **Conversation History:** Maintain a history of user queries and system responses.

### **4.3. Voice Integration**

* **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Convert spoken queries into text for processing by the RAG system.  
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Convert the RAG system's text responses into natural-sounding speech.  
* **Voice Activation:** (Optional) Implement a "wake word" or button activation for the voice agent.

### **4.4. Personalization**

* **User Isolation:** Ensure each user's documents and knowledge base are entirely separate and private from others.  
* **User Authentication:** Secure access to personal knowledge bases.

## **5\. Architecture (High-Level)**

The system will follow a microservices-oriented architecture, primarily consisting of three logical components: the Data Ingestion Pipeline, the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Core, and the User Interface & Voice Layer.

  2. **Vector Database Search:** The query embedding is used to perform a similarity search in the Vector Database, retrieving the most relevant document chunks.  
  3. **LLM Augmentation:** The retrieved chunks are combined with the original user query and sent to a Large Language Model.  
  4. **Response Generation:** The LLM synthesizes a coherent and accurate answer based on the provided context.

### **5.3. User Interface & Voice Layer**

* **Purpose:** Provides the user-facing interaction.
